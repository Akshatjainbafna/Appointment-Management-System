# Homoeo-Amigo-Assignment

The project is a backend of an appointment management system build using Firebase(Database) and Express.js(Backend Framework). I have used Firebase Authentication to manage authentication and authorisation.
The project can be cloned and tested using platforms like Postman.

All APIs endpoints should send data in x-www-form-urlencoded data.

POST `/register`: Register a user.
POST `/login`: Authnticate a user.
GET `/appointments`: Retrieve all appointments.
POST `/appointments`: Create a new appointment.
GET `/appointments/:id`: Retrieve a specific appointment by its ID.
PUT `/appointments/:id`: Update a specific appointment by its ID.
DELETE `/appointments/:id`: Delete a specific appointment by its ID.
